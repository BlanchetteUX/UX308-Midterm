Season 10 of RuPaul's Drag Race, was definitely one for the herstory books, with some moments that had us as viewers gagging in our chairs at home. With 12 Emmy nominations, and a win for "Outstanding Reality Show Progam", RuPaul's is building a mainstream media following. With season 11 now on netflix and season 12 currently airing, what is our season 10 winner Aquaria currently up to?
