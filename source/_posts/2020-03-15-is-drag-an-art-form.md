Yes.

For many fans of drag, and RuPaul's Drag Race this question may seem rudimentary, however there are some who may not know why this is an art form.

Drag is not only a style of makeup, which is already viewed as an art form, but many Drag Queens have dance and/or vocal training, as they are always on stage performing.

Performance art, from acting, to the more abstract and obscure exhibits seen at the Met, is a very real art form, that takes the utmost skill and dedication.



Combining both make-up skills and performance skills is not an easy task, making drag a truly fierce style of art.
