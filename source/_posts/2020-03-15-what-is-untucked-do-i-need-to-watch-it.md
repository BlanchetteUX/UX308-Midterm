Untucked is the gossip centre of Drag Race, it takes place during the mainstage runway eliminations and critiques. If you have ever seen an episode of Drag Race, when RuPaul tells the contestants "You may go backstage and untuck", they do in fact go backstage, and are provided with drinks, and talk about things ranging from who they believe will be in the bottom 2 this week, as well as airing out their dirty laundry providing, us the viewers, some juicy juicy reality tv gossip that we all crave.

Now the question of untucked being a necessity to watch. Yes and no. You will miss out on many of the fights, that create tension, and can be seen in the werk room during the show, leaving some viewers feeling lost; however when major drama happens, and the Queens attempt to resolve it, or even better, it blows up even more, the show will often reference the fight from untucked provide clips for context to help the viewer feel a little less lost. Although the best is to see it first, as it sheds light on the queens personality more, and can help the viewers at home rally behind their favourite queens, or jump ship when it turns out their stan is a shady lady.
